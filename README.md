# Folder-Copy-Move

An asynchronous folder copy/move WinForm app.

This app also has a timer loop function that will let you pause the current file transfer until a certain time period (currently set to 6pm)
and also has stops after a certain time period (currently set to 7am), which it then starts the next timer. This will allow large moves
with no fear of bogging down slow networks systems by doing them at a non-operation times.
